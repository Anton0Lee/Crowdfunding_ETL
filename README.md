# Crowdfunding_ETL  
Data Analysis Project 2  
This repo contains a ETL_Mini_Project.ipynb which collects the 2 excel data from the Resources folder and produce 4 csv files after some data cleaning by Pandas manipulation and regex extraction.  
A ERD is then created using QuickDBD for the tabes in the csv files.  
Then they the tables are imported into SQL, the codes shown in the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file.
